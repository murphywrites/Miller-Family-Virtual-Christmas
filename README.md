# Miller-Family-Virtual-Christmas

This is a site I built in order to organize the zoom links, agenda, and virtual game list for my family's virtual Christmas party

We had a lot of fun playing games together and moving from "room" to "room" in our best attempt to make this very strange year apart for the holidays a little warmer.
